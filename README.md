# Drop-down Menus

A simple dropdown menu for the Odin Project's Dynamic User Interface Interactions section. 

- You can allow the menu to show up either on click or on hover.
- You should hard-code the menu items into your HTML but hide/reveal them using JavaScript. You can do this either by adding a class (visible or something) or by manually setting the style in JS.
- Make sure the code is reusable! You should be able to create multiple drop-downs on a page without repeating the JavaScript code.
- If you bundle your code into a module you can publish it to npm and then install and use it anytime you like! Nothing like publishing your own modules to make you feel like a pro ðŸ˜Ž.
